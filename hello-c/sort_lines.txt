A text line shuffler can be useful if you're doing cross-browser testing.
For example, if you're testing forms that needs unique content, then you can randomize a string list and paste it in the forms.
As the order of shuffled lines is unpredictable, each form will have unique text in them.
Similarly, if you need to write a browser test or an algorithm that checks for duplicate content, then you can shuffle lines, and then feed it to the algorithm.
As the lines were shuffled, the data is the same and only the order is different.
Another use case is simply shuffling data and picking random items from data.
Once you shuffle a string list, you can take the top elements and the result will be exactly the same as picking random items from the list.
